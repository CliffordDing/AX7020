*
*                                      DHCPc MULTIPLE INTERFACE
*
* Filename      : dhcp-c_multiple_if.c
* Version       : V2.10.00
* Programmer(s) : AA
*********************************************************************************************************
* Note(s)       : (1) This example shows how to initialize uC/DHCPc, start DHCP negotiation on many interface
*                     and return only when all DHCP negotiation are completed.
*
*                 (2) This example is for :
*
*                       (a) Many interfaces.
*                       (b) uC/TCPIP - V3.00.01
*                       (b) uCOS-III - V3.00
*
*                 (3) This file is an example about how to use uC/DHCPc, It may not cover all case needed by a real
*                     application. Also some modification might be needed, insert the code to perform the stated
*                     actions wherever 'TODO' comments are found.
*
*                     (a) For example this example doesn't manage the link state (plugs and unplugs), this can
*                         be a problem when switching from a network to another network.
*
*                     (b) This example is not fully tested, so it is not guaranteed that all cases are cover
*                         properly.

*                                      AppDHCPc_InitMultipleIF()
*
* Description : This function initialize uC/DHCPc and start DHCPc negotiation for many interfaces. This
*               function returns only the DHCP negotiation is completed.
*
* Argument(s) : if_nbr_tbl      Table that contains interface ID to be initialized with uC/DHCPc
*
*               nbr_if_cfgd     Number of interface to initialized (contained in tables)
*
*               if_dhcp_result  Table that will receive the DHCPc result of each interface to initialize.
*
* Return(s)   : DEF_OK,   Completed successfully.
*
*               DEF_FAIL, Initialization failed.
*
* Caller(s)   : Application.
*
* Note(s)     : (1) Prior to do any call to DHCPc the module must be initialized. If the process is successful,
*                   the DHCP client s tasks are started, and its various data structures are initialized.
*
*               (2) Start the DHCP management of the interfaces. Note that the interface is not configured yet upon
*                   returning from this function.
*
*               (3) An OS time delay must be applied between each call to DHCP to allow other task to run.
*
*               (4) Once the DHCP management of an interface has been started, the application may want to check the
*                   status of the lease negotiation in order to determine whether or not the interface has been properly
*                   configured:
*
*                   (a) Status DHCP_STATUS_CFG_IN_PROGRESS means that the negotiation is still underway.
*
*                   (b) Status DHCP_STATUS_CFGD indicates that the DHCP negotiation is done and that the interface is
*                       properly configured.
*
*                   (c) Status DHCP_STATUS_CFGD_NO_TMR specifies that the DHCP negotiation is done and that the interface
*                       is properly configured, but no timer has been set for renewing the lease. The effect of this is
*                       that the lease is going to be permanent, even though the server might have set a time limit for it.
*
*                   (d) Status DHCP_STATUS_CFGD_LOCAL_LINK means that the DHCP negotiation was not successful, and that a
*                       link-local address has been attributed to the interface. It is important to note that the DHCP
*                       client will not try to negotiate a lease with a server at this point.
*
*                   (e) Status DHCP_STATUS_FAIL denotes a negotiation error. At this point, the application should call
*                       the DHCPc_Stop() function and decide what to do next.
